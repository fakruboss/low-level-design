TIC TAC TOE GAME:

1. played between two players
2. positions are inputted from the users (from 1 to 3 for a 3x3 board) which is currently generated
   using rand
3. all the moves are stored (across all games)
4. N games can be set to be played (hardcoded as 10k for now) and the summary for each player will
   be print out
5. Summary included total games played, number of wins and match drawn

Future implementations planned:

1. undo move
2. store the moves of each game separately
3. add a timer restriction (!?)
